Do you need use socks proxy in apt?

It is very easy  just 

open apt.conf in /etc/apt/apt.conf with your favorites editor for example use xed in Linux mint  (If the file in path it is not exist make it :D)

xed /etc/apt/apt.conf

and add this code in it 

Acquire::http::Proxy "socks5h://your_proxy_server:port";
