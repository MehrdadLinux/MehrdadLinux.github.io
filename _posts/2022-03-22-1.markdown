Vagrant-cachier is a vagrant plugin that helps you reduce waiting for boxes to be provisioned by sharing a common package cache among similar VM instances

## Installation
    
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-cachier


## How to use it

    Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
        config.vm.box = 'your-box'
            if Vagrant.has_plugin?("vagrant-cachier")
                config.cache.scope = :box
                config.cache.synced_folder_opts = {
                    type: :nfs,
                    mount_options: ['rw', 'vers=3', 'tcp', 'nolock']
                }
            end
    end


## Fedora and dnf Problem

When you try to use a Vagrant-cachier with Fedora, you get an error like this

VagrantPlugins::Cachier::Bucket::Dnf

    /install_buckets.rb:43:in `block in configure_cache_buckets'
    /root/.vagrant.d/gems/2.6.6/gems/vagrant-cachier-1.2.1/lib/vagrant-cachier/bucket.rb:23:in `install': uninitialized constant VagrantPlugins::Cachier::Bucket::Dnf (NameError)

or 

## yum not found

    Vagrant assumes that this means the command failed!
    sed -i 's/keepcache=0/keepcache=1/g' /etc/yum.conf
    Stdout from the command:
    Stderr from the command:
    sed: can't read /etc/yum.conf: No such file or directory
