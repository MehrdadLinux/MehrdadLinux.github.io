When I want to give an IP to a service, I usually use DHCP Reservation and static the IP value by mac if you are in the ESXI system.
In some cases, you will face the following problem.
DHCP answered the IP request, but the ESXI did not set the IP.

Answer :

The reason for this situation is that in this DHCP server, the default gateway value is not set and only gives the IP
That is why ESXI does not accept this IP from DHCP.

So you need to make sure your DHCP sets the default gateway value.
